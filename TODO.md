# TODO

- Add brightness setting (0-100) to allow brightening dark images
- Instead of using 2d vectors throughout the program, flatten them into single vectors
- Speed up GIF encoding (seems to take up the most time when converting GIFs)
- Probably should remove the "Internal" error since it's vague.

## Bugs

- `--invert` causes a weird reordering of the `--char-override` value (RASCII issue).
